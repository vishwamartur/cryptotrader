# Test Coverage Configuration for CryptoTrader Project

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive test coverage configuration implemented for the CryptoTrader project to ensure high-quality code coverage while preventing build artifacts from being committed to the repository.

## Configuration Files

### 1. Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)

Our Jest configuration includes:

- **Multi-environment support**: Different configurations for unit, integration, security, performance, and UAT tests
- **TypeScript support**: Full TypeScript compilation with ts-jest
- **Coverage collection**: Optimized for CryptoTrader's file structure
- **WebSocket mocking**: Enhanced mocking for real-time trading features

#### Key Coverage Settings:

```javascript
collectCoverageFrom: [
  'lib/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  'components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  'hooks/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  'app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  // Exclusions for test files, build artifacts, etc.
]
```

#### Coverage Thresholds:

- **Global**: 70% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **WebSocket Components**: 85% (critical for real-time trading)
- **Trading Components**: 80% (high importance for financial operations)

### 2. Enhanced Jest Setup (`__tests__/jest.setup.js`)

Features:
- **MockWebSocket class**: Comprehensive WebSocket simulation
- **Crypto API mocking**: HMAC authentication support
- **Performance API mocking**: For Node.js environment
- **Fetch API mocking**: For AI API calls

### 3. Package.json Scripts

Cross-platform compatible scripts using `cross-env`:

```json
{
  "test:coverage": "cross-env TEST_TYPE=all jest --coverage",
  "test:coverage:unit": "cross-env TEST_TYPE=unit jest --coverage",
  "test:coverage:open": "cross-env TEST_TYPE=all jest --coverage && start coverage/lcov-report/index.html",
  "test:coverage:websocket": "jest --coverage --testPathPattern=\"delta-websocket|websocket-performance\"",
  "coverage:check-artifacts": "node scripts/check-coverage-artifacts.js"
}
```

## Coverage Artifact Prevention

### 1. Enhanced .gitignore

Comprehensive exclusions for:
- `/coverage` - Main coverage directory
- `*.lcov` - LCOV report files
- `/nyc_output`, `/.nyc_output` - NYC coverage files
- Build artifacts, IDE files, OS files

### 2. Coverage Artifact Checker (`scripts/check-coverage-artifacts.js`)

Automated script that:
- ✅ Checks staged files for coverage artifacts
- ✅ Verifies .gitignore configuration
- ✅ Detects existing tracked coverage files
- ✅ Provides remediation instructions

## Usage Guide

### Running Coverage Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run unit tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage:unit

# Run WebSocket-specific coverage
npm run test:coverage:websocket

# Open coverage report in browser
npm run test:coverage:open
```

### Preventing Coverage Commits

```bash
# Check for coverage artifacts before committing
npm run coverage:check-artifacts

# This is automatically run to prevent accidental commits
```

### Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in multiple formats:
- **HTML**: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` (interactive)
- **LCOV**: `coverage/lcov.info` (CI/CD integration)
- **JSON**: `coverage/coverage-final.json` (programmatic access)
- **Text**: Console output (immediate feedback)

## Best Practices

### 1. Focus Areas for Coverage

- **Trading Logic**: Prioritize algorithms, risk management, portfolio optimization
- **WebSocket Implementation**: Critical for real-time data streaming
- **API Integration**: Delta Exchange connectivity and error handling
- **Security Components**: Authentication, encryption, data validation

### 2. Exclusions

Files excluded from coverage:
- Type definitions (`.d.ts`)
- Test files (`.test.ts`, `.spec.ts`)
- Configuration files
- Build artifacts
- Index files (re-exports only)

### 3. Coverage Thresholds

- **Critical Components** (85%): WebSocket clients, trading engines
- **Important Components** (80%): Portfolio management, risk assessment
- **Standard Components** (70%): UI components, utilities
- **Global Minimum** (70%): Overall project coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Coverage Files Accidentally Committed

```bash
# Remove from staging
git reset HEAD coverage/

# Remove from repository but keep locally
git rm -r --cached coverage/

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove coverage artifacts from repository"
```

### Coverage Not Generated

1. Check Jest configuration
2. Verify file patterns in `collectCoverageFrom`
3. Ensure TypeScript compilation is working
4. Check for syntax errors in test files

### Low Coverage Warnings

1. Review uncovered lines in HTML report
2. Add tests for critical business logic
3. Consider if exclusions are appropriate
4. Update thresholds if necessary

## Integration with CI/CD

The configuration supports CI/CD integration:

```bash
# CI-friendly command
npm run test:ci

# Generates coverage reports without interactive features
# Fails if coverage thresholds are not met
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Review coverage reports** monthly
2. **Update thresholds** as codebase matures
3. **Add new file patterns** when adding new modules
4. **Verify .gitignore** effectiveness

### When Adding New Components

1. Add file patterns to `collectCoverageFrom`
2. Set appropriate coverage thresholds
3. Create corresponding test files
4. Update documentation

## Summary

This configuration ensures:
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage collection for TypeScript codebase
- ✅ Prevention of coverage artifacts in repository
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ CI/CD integration support
- ✅ Focus on critical trading and WebSocket components
- ✅ Automated verification and prevention tools

The setup addresses the previous issue where 145,694 lines of coverage files were accidentally committed, ensuring a clean repository while maintaining high code quality standards.
